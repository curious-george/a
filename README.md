Shunkichi

Everyone was yawning. "Where should we go now?" asked Shunkichi.

"There's nowhere to go in the middle of the day."

"We dropped them off at the beauty salon," Mitsuko and Tamiko said. They were basically fine.

Neither Shunkichi nor Osamu had any objection to seducing the two women there and then. Kyoko was the only woman left in the car. Mitsuko and Tamiko also had no objection to leaving Kyoko in the car. Shunkichi and Osamu gave a very simple farewell bow, each in their own way. They were all hoping for a gentle greeting from Natsuo, who was not their partner. And indeed Natsuo fully lived up to those expectations.

It was around three o'clock in the afternoon in early April in the year 1954. Natsuo's car, driven by Senkichi, went round and round on the one-way streets in the town. Where should we go? That's right, somewhere not so crowded.

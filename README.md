Shunkichi

Everyone was yawning. "Where should we go now?" asked Shunkichi.

"There's nowhere to go in the middle of the day."

"We dropped them off at the beauty salon," Mitsuko and Tamiko said. They were basically fine.

Neither Shunkichi nor Osamu had any objection to seducing the two women there and then. Kyoko was the only woman left in the car. Mitsuko and Tamiko also had no objection to leaving Kyoko in the car. Shunkichi and Osamu gave a very simple farewell bow, each in their own way. They were all hoping for a gentle greeting from Natsuo, who was not their partner. And indeed Natsuo fully lived up to those expectations.

It was around three o'clock in the afternoon in early April in the year 1954. Natsuo's car, driven by Senkichi, went round and round on the one-way streets in the town. Where should we go? That's right, somewhere not so crowded.

MOVEMENT VE

The metal plate on which the train tracks ran was black and silent, with nothing on it, and cars and people were looking back at it from both sides.

Before long, the centre of the iron plate began to swell and swell. This part gradually raised its head and a crack opened up. The iron plate rose up, and the iron balustrades on either side and the iron arch that straddled it also rose up roughly, with the dimly lit electric lights still attached to their pillars. Natsuo thought this movement was beautiful.

Just as the iron plate was about to become completely vertical, a great number of earthworks fell, thin streamers rising from either side of it and from the depressions in the tracks. The small shadows of the countless iron plates on both sides gradually converged and touched the iron plates, and the shadows of the railings on both sides also began to move, gradually distorting their angles. Then, when the iron plate became completely vertical, the shadows also became still. Natsuo raised his eyes and saw a bird brushing past the pillar of the fallen iron arch.

……………And so, the four of them unexpectedly found themselves faced with a large iron seat.

It felt like we had been waiting a long time. After the bridge was restored, we no longer had as much interest in going to the reclaimed land as we had before. Instead, we felt a sense of obligation to go there now that the bridge was restored. In any case, everyone was thinking,

The lack of sleep, the fatigue of the journey, and the warm weather made it hard to think things through or revise plans. Since we were heading for the sea anyway, we just had to go as far as we could. Without saying a word, and yawning again, the group slowly returned to the car.

After crossing the Reimei Bridge, we passed through the town of Tsukishima and then crossed the Reimei Bridge again. As far as the eye could see, the plain was blue and clear, broken up by a wide, checkerboard-patterned paved road. The sea breeze brushed against our cheeks. Fujikichi stopped the car at the edge of the US military facility, following a no-trespassing sign that marked the runway. Several poplar trees were shining in the sun beside the US military barracks.

As he got out of the car, Natsuo felt happy at the sight, and thought to himself, I prefer either ruins or reclaimed land. However, being quiet and modest, he didn't voice any of his opinions. Artistic opinions and the like were not the sort of thing you could keep to yourself and feel bad about, and Natsuo liked the fact that these guys didn't share that kind of sentiment.

But on that day, he looked at it without any intention. The huge white ship beyond the artificial wilderness, the coal ship with the white well-shaped hole that suddenly appeared as it left the painting, and other things like that were really neat and fun to look at. And the essence of this volume, where the artificial flat geometric land of the reclaimed land is full of play, is

The sky was endless. Before I knew it, the figure was dwindling in size at the end of the field.

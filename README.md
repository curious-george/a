Shunkichi

Everyone was yawning. "Where should we go now?" asked Shunkichi.

"There's nowhere to go in the middle of the day."

"We dropped them off at the beauty salon," Mitsuko and Tamiko said. They were basically fine.

Neither Shunkichi nor Osamu had any objection to seducing the two women there and then. Kyoko was the only woman left in the car. Mitsuko and Tamiko also had no objection to leaving Kyoko in the car. Shunkichi and Osamu gave a very simple farewell bow, each in their own way. They were all hoping for a gentle greeting from Natsuo, who was not their partner.

The small shadows of the countless iron plates on both sides gradually converged and touched the iron plates, and the shadows of the railings on both sides also began to move, gradually distorting their angles. Then, when the iron plate became completely vertical, the shadows also became still. Natsuo raised his eyes and saw a bird brushing past the pillar of the fallen iron arch.

……………And so, the four of them unexpectedly found themselves faced with a large iron seat.
